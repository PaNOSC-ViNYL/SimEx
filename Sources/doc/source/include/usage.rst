Usage
-----
The intended usage scheme of simex_platform is that of a python module in either an interactive (i)python session or a python script. Hence, the first thing to do is to import the module.

>>> import SimEX

A good starting point for finding examples on how to use simex_platform modules are the tests under `
`Tests/python/unittest/SimExTest/`. Each Calculator is tested, and the test-suite `PhotonExperimentSimulation/PhotonExperimentSimulationTest.py` contains some simex_platform workflow examples for complete start-to-end simulations.

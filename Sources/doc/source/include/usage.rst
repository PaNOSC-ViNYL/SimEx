Usage
-----
The intended usage scheme of SIMEX platform is that of a python module in either an interactive (i)python session or a python script. Hence, the first thing to do is to import the SimEx API module.

>>> import SimEX

A good starting point for finding examples on how to use SIMEX platform modules are the tests under
``Tests/python/unittest/SimExTest/``. Each Calculator is tested, and the test-suite ``PhotonExperimentSimulation/PhotonExperimentSimulationTest.py`` contains some SIMEX platform workflow examples for complete start-to-end simulations.

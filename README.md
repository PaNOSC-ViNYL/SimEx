## Purpose of SimEx

SimEx is a python library to facilitate setup, execution, and analysis of
simulations of experiments at advanced laser light sources.
As an example, consider a molecule radiated by highly brilliant,
ultrashort x-ray pulses such as delivered by an X-Ray Free Electron Laser (X-FEL).
The simulation platform allows to combine tools and codes for the
simulation of each step of the experiment: Generation of radiation in the
photon source, propagation through optics and waveguides to the interaction
point, photon-matter interaction, scattering of the radiation into the far
field and detection of the latter. The platform provides slots and
interfaces for the various simulation steps.

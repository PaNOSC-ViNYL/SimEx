## Purpose of SimEx

SimEx is a python library to facilitate setup, execution, and analysis of
simulations of experiments at advanced laser light sources.
As an example, consider a molecule radiated by highly brilliant,
ultrashort x-ray pulses such as delivered by an X-Ray Free Electron Laser (X-FEL).
The simulation platform allows to combine tools and codes for the
simulation of each step of the experiment: Generation of radiation in the
photon source, propagation through optics and waveguides to the interaction
point, photon-matter interaction, scattering of the radiation into the far
field and detection of the latter. The platform provides slots and
interfaces for the various simulation steps.

# Install
Get source code:
```
git clone --depth 1 -b master https://github.com/PaNOSC-ViNYL/SimEx.git
```

## CENTOS 8
```
yum install -y hdf5 hdf5-devel fftw-devel flex bison
```

### Conda (preferred)
```
wget -c -O /tmp/miniconda.sh https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
sh /tmp/miniconda.sh
```

 * Select a directory XX where to install miniconda, consider 5GB of free disk space.
 * Add the XX/miniconda/bin/ directory to your path

```
./install.sh conda-env
conda init $SHELL
```
restart your shell
```
conda activate simex
./install.sh conda
```
<!--- ## CENTOS non conda --->

## Development
The size of this Github repository of SimEx is huge due to the historical TestFiles.

This command can clone only the newest develop branch to reduce the dowloading size:
```
git clone --depth 1 -b develop https://github.com/PaNOSC-ViNYL/SimEx.git
```
Now the TestFiles are hosted at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3750541#.X2R9DZMzZE5).
The files can be downloaded with [this script](get_testdata.sh).
